This is a windows service installer and basic settings tool for ElasticSearch on windows. 

This creates a windows installer program to install the windows service that just uses the java command line that would normally be created by elasticsearch.bat

When starting the service it runs the command line and sends the output to a log file. The installer will not automatically start the service. I recommend using the setup tool before you start the service.    

The windows forms setup tool is for configuring environmental variables, creating log directories, setting permissions, opening firewall ports   and starting/stopping the windows service. 

Prerequisite:
.net Framework 4
Java

Install process
1.  You can basically put ElasticSearch in a directory on your system. 
2.	Take the ElasticsearchServiceSetup.msi from the output install it.
3.	Start > All Programs > Elasticsearch Setup > SetElasticsearchSettings.exe (Right click and run as administrator … Note this is important for it to work)

From there you can set your: 
environment variables JAVA_HOME, ES_HOME, ES_MIN_MEM, ES_MAX_MEM  (These work for the .bat as well)
Save your variables … This will create a directory under ES_HOME for the service log files and give permissions to “NETWORK SERVICE” (This is the same account used for the windows service you can changes this as needed) on ES_HOME. 

You can optionally open firewall ports 54328 UDP, and 9200 and 9300 from the “Open Firewall Ports” button. 

And start and stop the windows service as well. 

There are things that I would have added like config file for the service so you can change the options without recompiling and an editor for the elasticsearch.yml to edit the configuration but I don’t have time for them. Any way this should make it easier to set up and install ElasticSearch on a windows server or PC. Hope this helps someone.
